# pBlockly
Portable Blockly, simplified Blockly to run Blockly apps (demos/samples/games) as local as possible.

Currently, the Blockly's original directory structure is reorganized by pushing Blockly's directories and files into the lib/blockly directory. P5.js directories are stored in the lib/p5 directory.
