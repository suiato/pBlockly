# pBlockly
Portable Blockly, simplified Blockly to run Blockly apps (demos/samples/games) as local as possible.
Branches:
1. main
1. developer: for developers, including minimum static build modules necessary to run apps
1. user: for users, who are interested in using Blockly(+p5.js blocks) without building modules, requiring only static scripts to run apps.
